# Blood-Cells-Recognition
Dataset:
The Complete Blood Count (CBC) Dataset  has been used for automatic identification and counting of blood cells. Download the dataset, unzip and put the Training, Testing, and Validationfolders in the working directory.
Getting Started
Build the cython extension in place python setup.py build_ext --inplace
Run the python file app.py and follow the link suggested.
We used dataset from Blood Cell Count Dataset(BCCD) from the MIT license.
The code was developed for the following blood cell detection paper. For a more detailed explanation of the proposed method, please go through the pdf of the paper. If you use this code or associated dataset, please cite this paper as:
